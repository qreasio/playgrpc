#PlaygRPC

This repo is used for personal learning and playing around with gRPC using Go.
There are two parts, gRPC client and gRPC server.

To see this works, we need to run gRPC server first then run gRPC client.

## Run gRPC Server

```sh
go run server/main.go
```

## Run gRPC Client


```sh
go run client/main.go
```

Output:
```sh
